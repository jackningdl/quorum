# Quorum

Quorum is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol with transaction/contract privacy and a new consensus mechanism.

Key enhancements:

* __QuorumChain__ - a new consensus model based on majority voting
* __Constellation__ - a peer-to-peer encrypted message exchange
* __Peer Security__ - node/peer permissioning using smart contracts

## Architecture

<a href="https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki/Transaction-Processing#private-transaction-process-flow">![Quorum privacy architecture](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-docs/raw/master/images/QuorumTransactionProcessing.JPG)</a>

The above diagram is a high-level overview of the privacy architecture used by Quorum. For more in-depth discussion of the components, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki/) pages.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get started with Quorum is using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples
cd quorum-examples/vagrant
vagrant up
# (should take 5 or so minutes)
vagrant ssh
```

Now that you have a fully-functioning Quorum environment set up, let's run the 7-node cluster example. This will spin up several nodes with a mix of voters, block makers, and unprivileged nodes.

```sh
# (from within vagrant env, use `vagrant ssh` to enter)
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ cd quorum-examples/7nodes

$ ./init.sh
# (output condensed for clarity)
[*] Cleaning up temporary data directories
[*] Configuring node 1
[*] Configuring node 2 as block maker and voter
[*] Configuring node 3
[*] Configuring node 4 as voter
[*] Configuring node 5 as voter
[*] Configuring node 6
[*] Configuring node 7

$ ./start.sh
[*] Starting Constellation nodes
[*] Starting bootnode... waiting... done
[*] Starting node 1
[*] Starting node 2
[*] Starting node 3
[*] Starting node 4
[*] Starting node 5
[*] Starting node 6
[*] Starting node 7
[*] Unlocking account and sending first transaction
Contract transaction send: TransactionHash: 0xbfb7bfb97ba9bacbf768e67ac8ef05e4ac6960fc1eeb6ab38247db91448b8ec6 waiting to be mined...
true
```

We now have a 7-node Quorum cluster with a [private smart contract](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples/blob/master/7nodes/script1.js) (SimpleStorage) sent from `node 1` "for" `node 7` (denoted by the public key passed via `privateFor: ["ROAZBWtSacxXQrOe3FGAqJDyJjFePR5ce4TSIzmJ0Bc="]` in the `sendTransaction` call).

Connect to any of the nodes and inspect them using the following commands:

```sh
$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd1/geth.ipc
$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd2/geth.ipc
...
$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd7/geth.ipc


# e.g.

$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd2/geth.ipc

Note in particular the `v` field of "0x25" (37 in decimal) which marks this transaction as having a private payload (input).
